            <p class="productarticledescription">4 points of joe roasting's buying philosophy
1) fair and traceable
at joe, we are committed to making certain that every green coffee transaction is both fair and traceable. in addition to purchasing coffee directly from producers, joe also works with importers, exporters and brokers who are equally committed to selling coffee that can be traced back to the farmer, group, or cooperative. through a traceable supply chain, we can ensure that farmers are paid well above both commodity prices and fair trade minimums for the coffees we buy.
2) quality
the joe sourcing and selection team maintains stringent standards when selecting green coffee for our menu. all beans, from the components of our house selection to our rotating cast of single origin coffees, have met or exceeded our intense quality standards. joe’s quality protocols require cupping (tasting) hundreds of samples of coffee per year, maintaining a seasonal rotation of beans, and working with importers and exporters who use the utmost care in transporting and storing the coffee.
3) flexibility
joe is committed to flexibility when purchasing green coffee. we understand that each and every coffee producing country has its own unique purchasing infrastructure. while joe works directly with farmers or cooperatives when possible, we also embrace other forms of ethical sourcing already established in certain regions. some of the coffee we buy is certified fair trade, organic or shade grown, but our purchases are not limited to farms that have secured such certifications.
4) sustainable relationships
joe strives to build sustainable and trusting relationships with importers, exporters, brokers and farmers. working with many of the same individuals each year can guarantee both quality coffee for joe and stability for our wholesale partners. additionally, relationships with importers and brokers formed on a trusting foundation help us to perennially source only the best coffee from around the world.</p>
