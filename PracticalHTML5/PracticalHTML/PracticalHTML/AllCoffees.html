Apukuna, CENFROCAFE, Peru
Apukuna is one of the highest quality lots from the Cenfrocafe Cooperative, in the Cajamarca region of northern Peru. Some of the areas around Cajamarca were not inhabited until 40 years ago, and this late start has allowed the coffee growers a unique opportunity to build infrastructure based on more up-to-date practices than other, more established coffee producing regions in Peru. Cenfrocafe is currently comprised of 2150 farmer members who work through 98 local associations under the Cenfro umbrella. The farms are typically very small ranging from 1.5-8 hectares and farmers often harvest their own coffee cherries with their families. After the cherries are depulped, the mucilage-covered seeds are fermented in small tanks for 15-18 hours before being washed with fresh water. When the beans are clean, they are dried on raised beds and delivered to local collection stations or directly to Cenfro’s drop-off warehouse. Every coffee is roasted and cupped by the QC team at Cenfro who end up cupping around 7000 samples each harvest! “Apukuna” or “Apu” is the designation given to the best coffees from Cenfrocafe, and the name, which translates as “Coffee fit for gods,” refers to the Incan mountain deities. This lot was grown between 1200 and 1600 meters above sea level and is comprised of Typica, Caturra, Bourbon and Mondo Novo varieties.</p>
